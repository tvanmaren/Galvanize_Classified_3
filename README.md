## Project Description

Now is your time to show off and make your Angular app pretty.

### Getting Started

Copy your files from **Part 2** into your project directory.  This is important: make sure you don't edit the part 2 files so we can evaluate each part independently.  This also allows you to redo pieces of this assessment individually.

### Requirements

You are responsible for:

- [ ] Forking and cloning this GitHub Repo.
- [ ] Styling your Angular front end.
- [ ] Deployment of the App on Heroku.

### Must haves

The app should implement the following:

- Valid, well-implemented HTML and CSS
- Readable and logical JavaScript
- Responsiveness for different screen sizes and orientations
- A logical and intuitive UI
